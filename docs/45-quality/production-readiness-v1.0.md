# Production Readiness

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Document** | Production Readiness — V1 |
| **Version** | v1.0 |
| **Status** | Draft |
| **Date** | 2026-10-07 |
| **Owner** | Project owner (Bulbula) |
| **Supersedes** | — |

## Scope

What must be true before Bulbula is exposed to the public: the
readiness criteria, the decisions that block launch, the legal items
that cannot be self-assessed, and the measurement that the launch bar
itself depends on.

**Out of scope.** Deployment mechanics
(`release-management-v1.0.md`), test design
(`test-strategy-v1.0.md`), post-launch upkeep
(`maintenance-v1.0.md`).

## Authority and precedence

| ID | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| PRR-0.1 | **This document sets no launch date, coverage number or readiness score.** The numeric launch bar is **D-30n**, derived from the pilot — **PENDING PILOT** |
| PRR-0.2 | **It does not decide any open item.** It lists what must be decided and by whom |
| PRR-0.3 | **It makes no claim of legal compliance.** Legal determinations are **PENDING COUNSEL** |
| PRR-0.4 | **The owner declares readiness.** This document does not declare it, and a complete checklist is not a declaration |
| PRR-0.5 | **A blocker is a blocker.** A blocker cannot be waived to meet a date; it can only be resolved, or the launch moves |

---

## 1. What launch means

| ID | Statement |
| --- | --- |
| PRR-1.1 | **Launch is the moment Bulbula publishes information about real businesses to the public.** Everything before it is reversible; this is not (PBD-1.3) |
| PRR-1.2 | **At launch, Bulbula becomes a controller of personal data in public**, with obligations that run from that moment (DI §3) |
| PRR-1.3 | **At launch, businesses that cannot edit their own data become dependent on the correction route working** (TS-1, TS-3) |
| PRR-1.4 | **Launching with thin coverage is a product failure; launching with wrong data is a trust failure.** The second is worse and is harder to undo |
| PRR-1.5 | **There is no "soft launch" that suspends any obligation in §5** |

---

## 2. How to use this document

| ID | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| PRR-2.1 | **Each item is binary: met or not met.** There is no partial credit |
| PRR-2.2 | **"Not met" with a reason is an honest state.** "Met" without evidence is not |
| PRR-2.3 | **Each item names its evidence.** The evidence is what is reviewed, not an assertion that the item is done |
| PRR-2.4 | **An item that cannot be met is escalated to the owner as a decision**: resolve, descope, or accept the risk explicitly and in writing |
| PRR-2.5 | **An accepted risk is recorded with who accepted it and when.** Silent acceptance is the failure mode this document exists to prevent |

---

## 3. Blocking decisions

**Launch cannot proceed while any of these is open.** Each is already
recorded as blocking in a document above this one.

| ID | Decision | Why it blocks | Marker |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| PRR-3.1 | **D-30n** — the numeric launch coverage threshold | There is no definition of ready without it | **PENDING PILOT** |
| PRR-3.2 | **D-31** — the 20-business pilot is executed | It produces D-30n and every operational baseline | **PENDING PILOT** |
| PRR-3.3 | **D-42 / D-42b** — hosting and data location | **No production environment exists**; residency is unresolved | **Open — product decision** |
| PRR-3.4 | **D-41** — email provider | Email OTP is a sign-in path; no provider means no sign-in | **Open — product decision** |
| PRR-3.5 | **D-14** — Operator/Administrator split | Staff permission assignment is provisional | **Open — product decision** |
| PRR-3.6 | **D-45** — staff authentication strength | Staff accounts reach all personal data | **Open — product decision** |
| PRR-3.7 | **D-23** — production secret custody | Secrets must exist somewhere accountable before production does | **Open — technical decision** |
| PRR-3.8 | **D-40** — launch-area boundary | Area data is provisional without it | **Open — product decision** |
| PRR-3.9 | **D-08** — verification methods and interval | Verification is the central trust claim | **Open — product decision** |
| PRR-3.10 | **The populated Category catalogue** — the content, not the model | Taxonomy is the backbone of browsing. **D-56 and D-57 were approved on 2026-10-07**, so the model and cardinality are settled; what remains is the **curated catalogue content**, which is an operations task | **Open — operational decision** |
| PRR-3.11 | **D-39** — commercial/editorial integrity controls | **Blocks the first paid Campaign**, not the launch itself | **Open — product decision** |

| ID | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| PRR-3.12 | **PRR-3.11 is a separate gate.** The directory may launch without advertising; it may not run a paid Campaign without D-39 (IN-6, ADV-12) |

| --- | --- |
| PRR-5.12 | **No item in §5 may be closed by staff judgement, by a web search, or by this documentation set** |

---

## 6. The readiness review

| ID | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| PRR-6.1 | **The review walks §3, §4 and §5 item by item, with evidence** |
| PRR-6.2 | **It happens before launch and is repeated if launch slips materially** |
| PRR-6.3 | **Its output is a written record**: which items are met, which are not, which risks the owner accepted and why |
| PRR-6.4 | **The owner declares readiness. Nobody else can** (PRR-0.4) |
| PRR-6.5 | **A failed item is reported as failed.** The purpose of the review is to find them |
| PRR-6.6 | **The review itself proves nothing about the data being true.** That is what the pilot and the operational gates are for |
