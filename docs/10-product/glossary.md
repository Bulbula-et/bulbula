# Bulbula Product Glossary

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Document** | Product Glossary |
| **Version** | v1.0 |
| **Status** | Draft |
| **Date** | 2026-10-07 |
| **Owner** | Project owner (Bulbula) |
| **Supersedes** | The provisional glossary in `docs/00-discovery/project-understanding-v0.1.md` §35 |

**Purpose.** One word per concept. Every product, design, technical and
operations document — and every user-visible string — uses the canonical term
below. Where a term has common synonyms, the synonyms are listed as
**deprecated** and must not appear in documentation, code identifiers, or UI
copy.

## 1. People and actors

| Term | Definition | Deprecated synonyms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **User** | Any human interacting with a Bulbula client surface. Umbrella term covering Guest and Customer. Not a role | end user, visitor (as a role) |
| **Guest** | An unauthenticated User. May browse, search and read public content | anonymous user, public user |
| **Customer** | An authenticated end user with a Bulbula account. The term for the demand side of the product | member, consumer, registered user (as a role name) |
| **Operator** | A Bulbula staff member who performs day-to-day listing and moderation work in the operations console | agent, editor, content staff |
| **Administrator** | A Bulbula staff member with higher-risk permissions: taxonomy, campaigns, user management, policy and audit access | admin user, superuser, owner (never use "owner" for staff) |
| **Staff** | Collective term for Operator and Administrator | team, back office |
| **Business owner** | The person who owns or manages a Business in the real world. **Not a platform user in V1** — has no account, no login and no self-service surface (D-54) | merchant, vendor, partner, client (as a platform role) |

**Rule.** V1 has exactly **three platform actors**: Guest, Customer, Staff
(split into Operator and Administrator). Any requirement that implies a
fourth actor is out of scope (D-54).

## 2. Core product entities

| Term | Definition | Deprecated synonyms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Business** | A commercial or service entity that Bulbula describes. The brand-level record: name, description, categories, website, social links | company, merchant, shop (as the entity name), place |
| **Branch** | A physical location belonging to a Business. Every Business has at least one Branch; single-location businesses have exactly one (D-03) | location, outlet, store, site, venue |
| **Listing** | The published representation of a Business and its Branches on Bulbula. The unit of publication, provenance, verification and freshness. A Business that has never been published has no Listing | entry, record, page, profile (as the data unit) |
| **Business profile** | The public page that presents a Listing to Users. The *presentation* of a Listing, not the data unit | business page, detail page |
| **Category** | A top-level classification in the Bulbula-controlled taxonomy (D-06) | type, sector, industry |
| **Subcategory** | A second-level classification beneath a Category. The taxonomy is exactly two levels in V1 (D-06) | sub-type, niche, child category |
| **Alias** | A controlled synonym attached to a Category, Subcategory or Area, used to improve search matching. May contain Amharic (D-06, D-18) | synonym (acceptable in prose), keyword, tag |
| **Area** | The user-facing location unit — a named neighbourhood or locality such as Bole Bulbula. Areas are curated, not free text | neighbourhood (acceptable in prose), locality, zone, district |
| **Sub-city** | The administrative unit above Area in Addis Ababa (*kifle ketema*). Stored for correctness; secondary in the interface | district, borough |
| **Landmark** | An optional named reference point used to help Users locate a Branch | POI, reference point |

## 3. Customer interactions

| Term | Definition | Deprecated synonyms |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Review** | A Customer's evaluation of a **Branch**, consisting of a required Rating and optional review text. A Review always concerns one Branch, never a Business directly (D-34, D-55) | comment, feedback, testimonial, post |
| **Rating** | The score a Customer assigns within a Review: an **integer from 1 to 5**, required (D-34) | score, stars (acceptable in UI copy only), grade |
| **Rating summary** | The aggregate rating displayed for a Branch or a Business: the **arithmetic mean of currently Published Review ratings** in that scope, with no weighting. A Business summary **aggregates its Branches' Reviews** (D-34) | average rating, overall score |
| **Save** | **The canonical name for the single capability** by which a Customer marks a Business for later. One capability, one verb (D-01 capability 14) | **favorite, favourite, like, bookmark, wishlist, follow** — all deprecated |
| **Saved list** | The collection of Businesses a Customer has Saved | favorites list, my list |
| **Report** | A User-submitted notification that something is wrong — either a data problem on a Listing or abusive content in a Review | flag, complaint, abuse report |
| **Correction** | A requested or applied change to Listing data arising from a Report, a staff check or a business contact | edit request, update request, change request |
| **Contact action** | A User action that initiates real-world contact with a Business: call, website visit, directions, social link | conversion, lead (deprecated — implies attribution Bulbula does not measure) |
| **Share** | A User action that distributes a link to a Business profile | send, forward |

**Note on "Save".** The product has one capability, not three. "Like" implies
a public social signal and "Favorite" implies a separate list; neither is in
scope. Use **Save** / **Saved** everywhere, including UI labels.
