# Bulbula V1 Scope

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **Document** | V1 Scope Reference |
| **Version** | v1.0 |
| **Status** | Draft |
| **Date** | 2026-10-07 |
| **Owner** | Project owner (Bulbula) |
| **Supersedes** | — (compact successor to `docs/00-discovery/product-decision-brief-v0.4.md` §4–§5) |

**Purpose.** The compact, authoritative answer to "is this in V1?". The PRD
references this document instead of restating scope lists. Decisions remain
authoritative in [`docs/60-decisions/decision-register.md`](../60-decisions/decision-register.md).

**Rule of interpretation.** If a capability is not listed in §1, it is **not**
in V1. Absence from §2 is not permission.

---

## 3. Future (post-V1, direction approved)

| Capability | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| Business accounts with **mandatory administrator approval** of every submission | D-54; architecture seams exist in V1, features do not |
| Owner-created listings and claims | D-02, same approval gate |
| Owner review replies | Requires business accounts |
| Self-service advertising and billing | Requires business accounts plus L-17/L-20 |
| Flutter client (Android, then iOS) | D-15, D-15r; same backend, same API contracts, separate client |
| Sign in with Apple | D-47 — likely required by App Store rules when the iOS client ships |
| Amharic interface | D-18 — separate owner approval |
| Expansion beyond the launch area | Location model already supports it |

## 4. Unresolved sub-decisions affecting V1

These do **not** change scope; they change detail inside an approved
capability. Full list in the decision register §2.

| ID | Affects | Must resolve before |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D-04 | Opening-hours model | UX / data model |
| D-08 | Verification rules and interval | UX / data model |
| D-09 | Completeness definition and ranking weight | UX / data model |
| D-13 | Identity-linking rules | Data model |
| D-14 | Operator / Administrator split | UX / data model |
| D-21 | Maps key, billing, fallback | UX |
| D-25 | Media storage and limits | Data model |
| D-27 | Analytics granularity and retention | Data model |
| D-33 | Telegram identity (**open evaluation**) | Mini App auth design |
| D-35 | Guest structured suggestions | UX |
| D-39 | Ad/editorial integrity controls | Implementation |
| D-41 | Transactional email provider | Implementation |
| D-42 | Data-location policy and hosting | Implementation |
| D-43 | Permission record contents and retention | Data model |
| D-44 | Services / products / pricing representation | Data model |
| D-45 | Staff authentication strength (**open**) | TRD / security |

**Closed at the M0 schema gate on 2026-10-07:** **D-34** (Review mechanics),
**D-55** (Business versus Branch attribute boundary), **D-56** (Category
catalogue production) and **D-57** (Category cardinality per Listing) were
approved and have left this table. They are recorded in
[`../60-decisions/decision-register.md`](../60-decisions/decision-register.md)
§1. The category **catalogue content** remains an operations task under D-56;
it is not a scope question.
